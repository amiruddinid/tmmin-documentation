# MDX
## What's MDX?

**MDX** is a syntax that combines Markdown (a lightweight markup language) and **JSX** (JavaScript XML). With MDX, you can write markdown for content, but you can also embed React components or other JavaScript functionality directly within that markdown.

## Why use MDX ?

1.  **Dynamic and Interactive Content**:

   One of the main benefits of using MDX is that it allows you to embed React components directly within the content. This means you can integrate dynamic, interactive UI elements into what would normally be static markdown content.
2. **Content Authoring Flexibility**:

   MDX allows content creators (e.g., writers, marketers) to write content using simple Markdown syntax, but without losing the ability to add advanced interactivity or layout components.
3. **Easier to Integrate React Components**:

   Since MDX allows you to embed JSX directly into markdown, you can easily integrate React components into your content. This is ideal for building custom, reusable components that might need to be injected into multiple markdown pages, such as code samples, tables, alerts, and charts.
4. **Type Safety with TypeScript**:

   MDX works well with TypeScript, which provides type safety. You can use TypeScript to validate props in your components, ensuring that the data being passed through the components is correct and adheres to your expected types.
5. **Component Reusability**:

   MDX allows you to define and reuse custom components across multiple pieces of content. For example, a "code block" component, a "callout" component, or a "video embed" component can be reused wherever needed in your markdown files without needing to duplicate content.
