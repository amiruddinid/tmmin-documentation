# Markdown

## What's Markdown ?

**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language used to format plain text, making it easier to create structured documents with rich formatting. It is often used in backend development for a variety of purposes, such as generating documentation, creating readme files, or rendering formatted content in web applications.

## Why use Markdown ?
1. **API Documentation Generation**:

   **Markdown** is often used in backend applications to generate **API documentation** in a human-readable format. Many modern frameworks like **Express**, **NestJS**, and **Fastify** support or integrate easily with tools like **Swagger UI** or **Redoc**. These tools often allow you to write your API documentation using Markdown syntax to describe endpoints, parameters, responses, and other details in an easily consumable format.

2. **Content Management (CMS)**:

   Many content management systems (CMS) or blogging platforms use Markdown as a backend format to store and manage content. Markdown files are lightweight and easy to work with when editing or updating posts. Backends can store Markdown-formatted text in databases, and then convert it into HTML when serving content to users.

3. **Data Serialization**:

   When building a backend system that needs to generate or manage content, **Markdown** can be used to serialize data in a lightweight, human-readable format. This is particularly useful when working with content that needs minimal formatting (e.g., articles, descriptions, or posts).

4. **User-Generated Content**:

   Many applications allow users to submit content in a rich text format. Rather than building complex text editors or relying on proprietary rich text formats, you can allow users to write content in **Markdown**, making it easier for them to format text.

5. **Lightweight and Portable**:

   Since Markdown is just plain text, it is portable and lightweight. It can be easily stored in databases, files, or version control systems (e.g., Git) without needing complex schemas or formats. This makes it a good option for storing and managing content in a simple, flexible way.
