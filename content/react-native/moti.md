# Moti
## What's Moti ?

**Moti** is a library for building smooth, interactive animations in **React Native**. It provides a set of high-level components and hooks to help developers create complex animations with minimal effort, making it easier to add animations to your React Native app.

Moti is built on top of the popular **Reanimated 2** library and offers a simplified, declarative API to handle animations, focusing on ease of use while still leveraging the power and performance of Reanimated 2 under the hood.

## Why use Moti ?

1.   **Ease of Use**:
    
       Moti simplifies animation development by abstracting away the complexity of working with Reanimated 2 directly. The declarative API makes it much easier to implement animations without needing to manually handle animation logic.
2.   **Performance**:
    
       Moti leverages the full power of Reanimated 2, ensuring that your animations are smooth, responsive, and performant even on devices with limited resources.
3.   **Declarative & Composable**:
    
       With Moti, animations are defined as a composition of states and transitions, making it easier to reason about the behavior of your animations and compose multiple animations in a clean and maintainable way.
4.   **Smooth Interactive Experiences**:
    
       Moti is designed for interactive UIs, enabling you to create intuitive animations that react to user gestures, scroll events, and state changes without any lag or jank.
5.   **Time-Saving**:
    
       Instead of manually setting up each animation using the low-level API, Moti provides pre-configured components and hooks that handle the heavy lifting, saving development time.
