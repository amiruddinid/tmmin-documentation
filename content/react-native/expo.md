# Expo
## What's Expo ?

**Expo** is a powerful open-source framework and platform for building **React Native** applications. It provides a set of tools, libraries, and services designed to simplify the process of developing mobile apps using **React Native**. Expo abstracts away many of the complexities involved in setting up and managing a React Native project, making it especially useful for developers who want to focus on building their app without dealing with the native configuration.

## Why use Expo ?

1.   **Zero setup for native environments**: No need for iOS or Android-specific configuration.
2.   **Fast development**: Instant previews with Expo Go and easy cloud-based builds with EAS.
3.   **Cross-platform**: Write once, deploy to iOS, Android, and Web.
4.   **Access to device features**: Ready-to-use APIs for camera, GPS, notifications, etc.
5.   **Over-the-Air updates**: Push updates without needing users to re-download the app.
6.   **Build and deploy**: Cloud-based tools for building and submitting apps.
7.   **No native code required**: Focus entirely on JavaScript or TypeScript.
